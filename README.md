# Accountabot

Accountabot is a discord bot that tracks the accountability of Discord Users in the server, and provides them with incentives to hold themselves accountable as well.

## Usage

This project is developed using the discord.py API extention module, and functions using a main bot class the pulls in series of commands developed within "cogs".
An SQLlite3 DB is being used to track user interaction with the bot and accountability functions. 

Further usage will be detailed as the project develops.
